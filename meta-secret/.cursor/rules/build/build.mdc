### Build system:
 - this project uses cargo to build rust code
 - this project uses earthly as a build system:
    - main build file is [Earthfile](mdc:Earthfile)
    - after updates in Cargo.toml files, run `earthly +generate-cargo-chef-recipe` to update the recipe.json file
      which caches all rust dependencies
