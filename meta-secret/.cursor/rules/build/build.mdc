### Build system:
 - there are two two main components in meta-secret:
   1. [web-cli](mdc:meta-secret/web-cli) - the web client
   2. [meta-secret application](mdc:meta-secret/core/src/node) - client and server applications
 - this project uses cargo to build rust code (application code)
 - this project uses earthly as a build system:
    1. main build file is [Earthfile](mdc:Earthfile)
    2. after updates in Cargo.toml files, run `earthly +generate-cargo-chef-recipe` to update the recipe.json file
      which caches all rust dependencies
