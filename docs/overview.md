# Meta Secret: Comprehensive Overview

## What is Meta Secret?

Meta Secret is a **decentralized password manager** that revolutionizes how we secure and manage sensitive information. Unlike traditional password managers that rely on a single master password, Meta Secret uses advanced cryptographic techniques to eliminate this single point of failure while providing secure, convenient access to your secrets across multiple devices.

## Core Purpose & Vision

Meta Secret addresses the fundamental problem with conventional password managers: **the master password vulnerability**. If someone gains access to your master password, all your secrets are compromised. Meta Secret solves this by:

- **Eliminating master passwords** entirely
- **Distributing trust** across multiple devices and locations  
- **Using biometric authentication** for secure access
- **Providing true decentralization** with no central authority or cloud dependency

## How It Works: Shamir Secret Sharing

At its core, Meta Secret employs **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)**, a cryptographic algorithm that splits any secret into multiple "shares" with these key properties:

### The Magic of Threshold Cryptography

```
Secret ‚Üí Split into N shares ‚Üí Requires only K shares to recover
```

**Example**: Your password is split into 5 shares, but you only need any 3 shares to recover the original password.

### Technical Process

1. **Secret Splitting**:
   - Your secret (password, private key, etc.) is split into multiple encrypted shares
   - Each share is mathematically related but reveals nothing about the original secret
   - Shares are encoded as both JSON files and QR codes for flexibility

2. **Distributed Storage**:
   - Store shares in different locations (devices, secure locations, trusted contacts)
   - No single location contains enough information to compromise your secret
   - Decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure

3. **Recovery Process**:
   - Collect the minimum threshold number of shares
   - Mathematical reconstruction recovers the original secret
   - Works with any valid combination of shares above the threshold
