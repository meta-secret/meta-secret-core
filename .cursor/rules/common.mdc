### Common Rules:
 - Don't write extensive documentation for almost any line of code. We need just bare minimum, only when additional explanations is needed and could be useful.

### Project Structure:
 - the project is structured in the following way:
    - [meta-secret application](mdc:meta-secret) - the main rust project, contains application logic
    - [infra](mdc:infra) - contains infrastructure code

#### Meta-Secret application, which consists of:
 - common code:
    - [common code](mdc:meta-secret/core/src/node/common)
    - [database](mdc:meta-secret/core/src/node/db)
 - [client](mdc:meta-secret/core/src/node/app)
 - [server](mdc:meta-secret/core/src/node/server)
